# Instabot

Free Instagram python bot, [private Instagram API emulator](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot/tree/master/instabot/api) and a [huge amount of ready-to-use example scripts](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot/tree/master/examples).

We are the most used Instagram library on GitHub (according to "Used by" counter). ðŸŽ‰ Join our [Large Telegram community](https://t.me/instabotproject) for more Instagram tricks. ðŸš€


### Important

Right now the usage of this library (as probably others too) may harm your Instagram's profile because of new script-detection algorithms. You were warned.
